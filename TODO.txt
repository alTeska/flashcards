ATM TODO:
1) functions check +  Eng<->Germ + bld interface
2) objects usage check (class Word?) + adjectives + make_sugest(!!)
3) guessed should come back with delay?
4) score counter
5) mistake correction showing -> 1.fuzzy.str, 2.additional requirement 3.show after last try -> print corrected version(at the end for now)
6) __str__ method for the class
7) pop up or gui [PyQt]
8) add a word by user

How it is supposed to work?
1. set up:
-both ways with language
-get input -> normalize
-setup
2.game breaks once guessed or out of chances

1. die as a separated check
2. die printed -> in the class add up with die and then send to print properly(print func may be needed)
3. die checked separately
4. words input in a different form, how to and how does it influence class structure
