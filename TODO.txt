ATM TODO:

2) words input in a different form, how does it influence class structure
3) guessed should come back with delay?
4) score counter
5) mistake correction showing -> 1.fuzzy.str, 2.additional requirement 3.show after last try -> print corrected version(at the end for now)
6) __str__ method for the class
7) pop up or gui [PyQt]
8) add a word by user

How it is supposed to work?
